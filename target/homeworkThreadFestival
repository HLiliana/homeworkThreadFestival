 * Every festival has a gate, where people have to show their tickets // festival, gate, showTickets, tickets
 * write an application where every person is represented by
 * a Thread that is instantiated with random ticket data // thread, randomTicketData
 * possible ticket types: full, full-vip, free-pass, one-day, one-day-vip // ticketType:
 * every attendee validates the ticket, and the ticket-data is kept is a queue // attendee, validateTicket, keepTicketData
 * meanwhile,
 * every 5 seconds a FestivalStatisticsThread wakes up and reads the new data  // wakeUpAndReadNewData
 * from the gate and generates statistics // gate, generateStatistics
 *
 100 people entered // peopleEntered
 57 people have full tickets // fullTickets
 30 have free passes // freePasses
 3 have full VIP passes // fullVipPasses
 10 have one-day passes // oneDayPasses
 0 have one-day VIP passes // oneDayVIPPasses

 NOTES

 there can be only one statisticsThread // statisticsThread
 statistics thread reads from the gate-data only if it's not empty // NotEmpty gate Data
 there can be unlimited attendee threads // attendeeThread
 attendee threads can add data to the gate regardless of the gate data being empty or full // addDataToTHeGate
 the application must randomly generate multiple attendee threads - at least 100
 use Thread.sleep() in both thread types

 Nouns:  festival, gate, tickets, thread, ticketType: fullTickets, freePasses, fullVipPasses, oneDayPasses, oneDayVIPPasses,

 Festival has a gate
 so festival is an interface or a class?
 festival has a gate, yes....composition
 gate verify tickets type
 more tickets type , so we use enum for them
 we choose random what type of ticket the attendee presents to the gate
 who validates the ticket?
 where do we keep ticket data?
 how and when do we wake up to read more data?
 who generates statistics?
 gate data should not be empty, we use an validation exception
